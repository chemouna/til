## View findViewWithTag
View class has a handy method (findViewWithTag)[http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#findViewWithTag(java.lang.Object)] to find a view by the tag it was set 
to, it has just a small caveat that it finds only view set with tag alone
and not keyed tags.
