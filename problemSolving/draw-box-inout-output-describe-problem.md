### Draw a box with input and output to describe a problem

While watching a talk by John Hughes (Creator of QuickCheck) he mentionned that he had a collegues 
that whenever he asks him when stuck on a problem he would draw a box with arrow in for input 
and arrow out for ouput and will let him describe each and the transformation he intend to do 
on them and he always hallfway finds the issue.
I have tried a couple of times and find extremely effective.
