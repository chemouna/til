til : chaining in Rx
Rx chain in a queue :
one sol for Running one at a time :
Scheduler scheduler = Schedulers.from(Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor());
observable.observeOn(scheduler). ...

another for only running one at a time for one type of requests
and multiple scheduler for others
like the case for refresh token in blablacar
