### Reading CS papers

In this [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kPMFkNm2dw) Nada Amin and William Byrd gave 
advice of how to read a paper i intend to follow when i'm reading papers :

- Start with the best papers on the subject you are interseted in and start with the introductory
   or survery papers or read dissertation of graduates.

- Start with the examples in the paper then look at the rules and try to code them or some close examples.

- look first at introduction and  abstract then at the bibliography and once you see a paper referenced a lot 
   it must be important then go read it (notice that this works also for books).
