## Always understand concepts clearly

While reading some Conal Elliott blog posts (I very much recommend them specialy if you're insterested in FRP)
I was struck by how much emphasis he put on understand each concept very well and not conflicting concepts 
with each other (I wish i could internalise and apply this habit).
