### Learning a new language by studying a project

I've found that when learning a new language one very practical tip is after learning 
the basics very well just pick one of the best open source projects build in that language
and research and learn everything you find in it that you don't understand is very good way to 
accelerate the learning process.
I did it when learning haskell using [Haxl](https://github.com/facebook/Haxl) project and in
clojure using [ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring), and everytime it was very useful.
